While I have been developing my TLC analyzer software, I realized that mostly the RF value was exciting for TLC users. So I developed a small piece of html file which can be opened in a browser (runs locally, platform independent) and handles your TLC image. Just click to the START then FRONT and you will have your densitogram with automatic peak RF calculation. It may happen some peaks are left, then you can apply a forced peak marking. Pressing key 'C' you can save the plot window. This is shown on the image. Let me know if you are interested.
